Words are a strange entity, I like to think of them as operators.

If we think of the collection of our mental states as a set, then we might as well begin the debate whether we can apply that awesome branch of Abstract Algebra: **Group Theory**.  

## Crash Course On Groups In words:

A group closure is when your set of words (operations) can lead you back to a situation (state) where you can repeat the prior movement.

## Cutting to the chase -- I gotta sleep too

Word groups are interesting -- group closures in language are a phenomenon occuring often in poetry, music lyrics, hypnosis, and rhetorical speeches. 

The set of words {"you","me"} is basically a group, occuring in an alternating fashion in the accented beat of musical choruses:

Happy Together by the Turtles 

I can't see me lovin' nobody but **you** 
For all my life 
When you're with me, baby the skies'll be blue 
For all my life 

Me and you and you and **me** 
No matter how they toss the dice, it has to be 
The only one for me is you, and you for me 
So happy **together** 

I can't see me lovin' nobody but **you** 
For all my life 
When you're with me, baby the skies'll be blue 
For all my life 

Me and you and you and **me** 
No matter how they toss the dice, it has to be 
The only one for me is you, and you for me 
So happy **together**
```

{you,me} is basically a group, but with enough {you,me} operations, the "together" becomes more probable Group closure in the **local** sense). 
Now bringing us to the question of how can we find a group in a systematic manner?

## The algorithm

We should expect (for smaller groups), a simple proportion of frequency. In so far as the group has a high %-of-closure, we would expect their usage to track eachother by a scaling factor.

The scaling factor exists to account for 
1) sometimes an operation will map back to other things which map back to it (% of time it leaves the group)
2) sometimes an operation will map back to itself.

Which brings up the point (which I should have spoken of earlier)
