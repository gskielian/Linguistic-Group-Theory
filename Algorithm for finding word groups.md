Words are a strange entity, I like to think of them as operators.

If we think of the collection of our mental states as a set, then we might as well begin the debate whether we can apply that awesome branch of Abstract Algebra: **Group Theory**.  

## Crash Course On Groups In words:

A group closure is when your set of words (operations) can lead you back to a situation (state) where you can repeat the prior movement.

## Cutting to the chase -- I gotta sleep too

Word groups are interesting -- group closures in language are a phenomenon occuring often in poetry, music lyrics, hypnosis, and rhetorical speeches. 

The set of words {"you","me"} is basically a group, occuring in an alternating fashion in the accented beat of musical choruses:

Happy Together by the Turtles 

I can't see me lovin' nobody but you 
For all my life 
When you're with me, baby the skies'll be blue 
For all my life 

Me and you and you and me 
No matter how they toss the dice, it has to be 
The only one for me is you, and you for me 
So happy together 

I can't see me lovin' nobody but you 
For all my life 
When you're with me, baby the skies'll be blue 
For all my life 

Me and you and you and me 
No matter how they toss the dice, it has to be 
The only one for me is you, and you for me 
So happy together
